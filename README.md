Algorithms and studies about internet of things.

## Temperature Sensors
Temperature sensors measure the amount of heat energy in a source, enabling them to detect temperature changes. They can be critical in any application where environmental or device temperatures have to be held at specific levels. These include manufacturing industries, agriculture, and health care.

## Humidity Sensors
Humidity sensors measure the amount of moisture or water vapor in air or other gases. Heating ducts, vents, and air conditioning systems in both industrial and residential settings often employ humidity sensors. The information they provide also assists in weather prediction and reporting applications.

## Pressure Sensors
These sensors detect changes in the pressure of gases and liquids and communicate these changes to connected systems. Commonly used in testing for leaks, pressure sensors are a vital component in the manufacturing and maintenance of water systems and other piped networks.

## Proximity Sensors
Proximity sensors often emit electromagnetic fields or beams of radiation such as infrared, as a means of detecting objects near the device, without making physical contact.  Parking lots at malls, stadiums, and airports use proximity sensors to indicate the availability of parking spaces. The sensors also have applications on the assembly lines of chemical plants, food production facilities, and many other types of industries.

## Level Sensors
In industries such as oil production, water treatment, or food and beverage manufacturing, level sensors can detect the level of substances, including liquids, powders, and granular materials. 

## Accelerometer Sensors
Accelerometers measure an object’s acceleration or the rate at which its speed or velocity changes over time. Some accelerometers can also detect changes in gravity. This makes them instrumental in applications such as vehicle fleet monitoring and in anti-theft systems that provide an alert if any object that should be stationary is being moved.

## Gyroscope Sensors
Gyroscope sensors measure an object’s speed and rotation around an axis, technically known as its angular rate or angular velocity. They are employed in-car navigation and anti-skid or electronic stability control systems. Gyroscope sensors also feature in motion-sensing tools for video games and camera-shake detection systems.

## Gas Sensors
Gas sensors monitor and detect changes in air quality, including the presence of toxic, combustible, or hazardous gases. The manufacturing, chemical research, mining, oil, and gas industries all use gas sensors. The carbon dioxide or smoke detectors used in many homes are another application.

## Infrared Sensors
Infrared sensors either emit or detect infrared radiation as a mechanism for sensing changes in their environment and can also measure the heat emitted by objects. In health care, infrared sensors simplify the monitoring of blood flow and blood pressure. Art historians using infrared sensors can unearth hidden layers in paintings. And in the home, televisions use infrared sensors to interpret the signals sent from a remote control.

## Optical Sensors
Optical sensors convert rays of light into electrical signals and are widely deployed in smartphones, where some ambient light sensors can extend battery life. In the health care sector, optical sensors are used in breath analysis and heart-rate monitors. And in the automotive industry, vehicles use optical sensors to recognize signs, obstacles, and other road features.

## Sound Sensors
Sound sensors detect sound waves through their intensity, converting them into electrical signals. Once a device detects a sound intensity change, it can send the data back to a dashboard. Besides detecting the presence of sound in an otherwise quiet room, some sensor systems incorporate tools that record sound as soon as the intensity changes, making them suitable for security purposes.
